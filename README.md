  Well organized minimalistic utilities for Deno
</p>

## Motivation

Deno libraries requires too many unnecessary permissions. We aims to reduce permission to use library by seperating files.
For example, we don't need to the I/O permission to compress raw data. So we should split the compression library into two files as 
the I/O related modules and the compression modules.
